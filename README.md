## 🧠 How Pricing Works

Each house price is calculated using the formula:

Price = Area * Base Price per Sqft * Quality Multiplier + Room Count * Room Multiplier


- `Base Price per Sqft`: ₹2500
- `Room Multiplier`: ₹50,000
- `Quality Multipliers`:
  - Excellent: `1.3`
  - Very Good: `1.2`
  - Good: `1.1`
  - Average: `1.0`
